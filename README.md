# raspberry-pi-workshop
Sample codes, demo's &amp; example programs for the Raspberry Pi workshop (Feb 17th 2016) for IEEE SB Sahrdaya.

##Sample code programs
* Blink in C
* Blink in Python
* Blink in node.js

##Demo code - Pi controlled kettle
A very wrong hacked implementation of a node server for the demo. But gets the task done...
Basically, I created a node server accepting GET requests at /,/start & /stop. Calls different code as response to the different GET requests. An HTML page with buttons to trigger GET request is used. A mobile phone connected to the same network of Raspberry Pi was used to do the demo.
The IP address of the Raspberry Pi needs to be hard-coded to the HTML page for the GET requests to work.
